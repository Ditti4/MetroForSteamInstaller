MetroForSteamInstaller
======================
Installer for the Metro for Steam skin for Steam (http://metroforsteam.com), currently being very alpha.
Feel free to clone and compile it. That's what the MetroInstaller.sln file is for.

Hm, I feel like I should add more text here...  
Let's stretch this  
file  
a  
little  
bit.  
That should be enough. Enjoy.
