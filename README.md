MetroForSteamInstaller (Visual Basic .NET)
==========================================
Installer for the Metro for Steam skin for Steam (http://metroforsteam.com), currently being very alpha.
Feel free to clone and compile it. That's what the MetroInstaller.sln file is for.

Building
--------
As the opening paragraph says: open MetroInstaller.sln with Visual Studio (I used the 2013 Express version), compile it, have fun.
